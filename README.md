AtliQ Hotels Hospitality Insights Provide Hospitality insights

Problem Statement:

AtliQ Hotels owns multiple five-star hotels across India. They have been in the hospitality industry for the past 20 years. Due to strategic moves from other competitors and ineffective decision-making in management, AtliQ Hotels are losing its market share and revenue in the luxury/business hotels category. As a strategic move, the managing director of AtliQ Hotels wanted to incorporate “Business and Data Intelligence” to regain their market share and revenue. However, they do not have an in-house data analytics team to provide them with these insights.

Workflow steps:

Data collection and exploration, create date table in Power Query (M language). Data load to Power BI and initial validation. Data Transformation in Power Query. Data Modelling and creating calculated columns. Creating measures using the DAX language. Build Executive View, Revenue View, Booking Insights and Performance Overview. Designing an effective Dashboard which includes page navigation with slicer panel, buttons,  using KPI’s. Deploying the report using Power BI Service.

Key Metrics: 

Revenue realized: 1.69 billion rupees RevPAR: 7,337 DSRN: 2,528 Occupancy percentage: 57.8% ADR: 12.70K Realization percentage: 70.1%

Recommendations:

1.Atliq Grands, a luxury hotel in Delhi, despite its good ratings, is underperforming in revenue generation. A strategic plan is needed to boost bookings and reduce cancellations. 
2.Atliq Palace in Hyderabad is struggling with low bookings, potentially due to low ratings. As a business hotel, its high ADR of 9,480 rupees and low Occupancy percentage need attention. 
3.Atliq Grands in Hyderabad is another hotel with lower revenue due to poor ratings and low Occupancy percentage. Efforts should focus on increasing bookings. 
4.The decline in revenue is primarily linked to low Occupancy percentages, which, in turn, result from fewer bookings. Strategies should be devised to enhance booking rates. ADR should be adjusted dynamically based on factors like the city, weekdays, and low-demand days to maximize revenue.
